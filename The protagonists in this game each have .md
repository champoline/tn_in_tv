The protagonists in this game each have a list of connections they know. They can go to them at any time to get some piece of information. This should be one of their first steps in any new venture.
#tn 
Encourage your players to make protagonists who are highly-visible and confrontational. Scheming con artists, hard-nosed detectives, brutal thugs, and over-confident hackers are a few starting points for more appropriate character concepts.

#tn Each of the connections a player chooses is someone her protagonist knows well—well enough to do her favors.

Henrik Hagen, [12/11/21, 1:57 am]
#tn Short version for char gen: the first time a connection is hit up for a favor, you add his name to your plot map. Each additional time the connection is hit up, you draw a line from the connection to one of the other existing nodes on the map. While you’re doing this, you’re inventing a reason that the connection is linked to this node plot-wise. What do they have to do with each other? Why should the protagonists be concerned? You get to ask (and sometimes answer) those questions.


#tn 
Relationship adjectives are how the protagonist feels about her connection; it doesn’t prescribe how the connection feels about her.

Henrik Hagen, [12/11/21, 2:04 am]
#tn Connections cannot provide more than two favors for the entire table during generation.

Henrik Hagen, [12/11/21, 2:09 am]
Connections are characters that a protagonist knows well—well enough to do her a solid. They can be trusted friends, family members, mentors, lovers, cohorts, and more. #tn

Henrik Hagen, [12/11/21, 7:21 am]
#tn Connections are characters the protagonists know well. Buddies, contacts, lovers, mentors, sidekicks. Some may even prove to be antagonists.


Threats are small groups of specialists that are used by connections and factions—or act on their own—to make agendas manifest.

#tn Keep the plot map openly in front of you during play. Let the players see when you add things to it. This will give them a sense that the plot is expanding and evolving as they interact with it. Still, it represents the mysteries, conspiracies, and occurrences yet to happen, so don’t let them read it.

Henrik Hage
#tn When the players start buying objects for their protagonists, they may start calling in favors from their connections. As gameplay starts, they’re going to find opportunities to hit them up for more. The first time a connection is hit up for a favor, add that connection’s name to the plot map. The second time he is hit up, draw a line from the connection’s name to one of the existing nodes on the map. This could be to one of the nodes of the mission seed, or to one of the other connections that you’ve added to the page. The players may not hit up any one connection for more than two favors during generation. Once a connection is associated to another node, he is done doing favors until runtime begins.   each time you draw a line on the map, you invent the relationship between those two nodes.
[1:08 PM]
Henrik Hagen, [12/11/21, 7:26 am]
#tn Connections continue to be added to the map and associated to other nodes as you play the game. This means that while connections pretend to be the protagonists’ friends, their involvement in the plot could lead them to try and exploit or double-cross the protagonists. Conflicts and stories emerge naturally as characters and relationships reveal themselves during play.

Henrik Hagen, [12/11/21, 7:36 am]
#tn During runtime, a protagonist can lean on her connections for information. She may be attempting to find some opportunity she can take advantage of or get further details of a plot she’s started to learn about. When this happens, have her player roll a die and consult that connection’s table in the Transmission (see “Connection Tables,” page 55). Add the resulting node to your plot map and draw a line from it to another node already on your map. As usual, invent a reason why this new node is associated with the existing node.   Once you have done this, take on the persona of the connection as he clues the protagonist in to the existence of this new node and how it relates to the node you linked it to. You might do this by hinting at rumors, revealing evidence of the node, or even by handing the node—if it’s an object or another connection—over to the protagonist herself.
[1:10 PM]
#tn If the protagonist asks for more information about a particular plot
node she’s become aware of, then follow the above procedure. When you get to the part where you attach the new node to an existing node, the existing node is the one she asked about. This allows you to frame the new lead as an answer to her inquiry.
If a protagonist asks for information that seems best answered with a
particular node type, forget rolling. Just select the node on the connection’s table that fits the bill. The plot map works for you, you don’t work for it.
In the event that rolling on the connection table results in a node that
already exists on your map, you don’t need to add it again. Instead, draw a line from that node to the connection being leaned on.
[1:10 PM]
Now, the protagonist has hit upon a part of the plot that the connection has a direct involvement with. When you take on the persona of the connection, you may be much less willing to divulge  the truth. Connections can lie and mislead. Just make sure you give the player some new information, even if it’s just having the connection act suspicious.
[1:11 PM]
#tn While the players are leaning on connections and gathering information, you’re looking for ways to start confronting the protagonists and getting them directly involved. There’s a certain point when the nodes on the map will add up, something goes off in your brain, and you’ll say “Oh, I know what’s going on now.” This is when you use the techniques covered in the following chapter, “Instigation” (page 67), to push towards resolving the issues created by the nodes on the map.   Alternatively, a protagonist might discover something you’ve revealed from the plot map and use that as an opportunity to confront one of your antagonists over it. This is exactly what hardboiled investigation is about. Forget sifting for clues. Get in someone’s face, make him nervous and scared, and see what he does when he’s desperate.   The number of nodes needed on a map to reach one of these two points varies depending on you and your group. As a general guideline, I have found that the three mission seed nodes, plus a couple of connections attached, plus one other node per player from leaning on connections for information is plenty to work with for your first session. Much more than that and you start over-complicating your map. Letting your players go to connections for information about once or twice per session after that keeps the plot evolving and fresh.   Once you feel you’ve used about half the nodes in your Transmissions, or if there’s some narrative concern that prompts it before then, you may want to take your show on the road and add a new Transmission to your ever-expanding plot (see page 64).   As some of the existing issues on your plot map are resolved, cross their nodes or lines off on the map.
[1:11 PM]
There’s no game mechanism for this (though mechanisms will be used in the process), but it should be fairly obvious in the narrative when some part of the plot comes to an end. The remaining nodes are loose ends that, once followed up on, can prove to be mysteries and conspiracies of their own. After a few sessions, if you have a fairly convoluted looking plot map, you might want to take three of your loose-end nodes, associate them with each other on a new blank piece of paper, and start a new plot map.

#tn I know that Risc feels obsessive towards Killia and Roman feels lustful
towards Dumas, so I think it would pretty dramatic to make it that Killia and Dumas are having an affair. But now the question is does Killia implicate herself in the plot to Risc? Killia would probably lie. But since Risc went to her for information, I have to give her something. So I tell Dessa that while Killia talks—completely deflecting all of her questions—Risc notices something familiar: a scent. She can smell Dumas’s cologne on Killia

Henrik Hagen, [12/11/21, 8:09 am]
#tn As soon as you have enough information to form agendas for the connections, factions, and threats involved in the plot, move away from composing your plot map and start using the nodes you have to instigate action, suspense, and drama.
If the players don’t seem sure what to do, encourage them to lean on a
connection for another lead or find a way to reveal a plot node they weren’t already aware of. When they have enough to go on that they become more active and form their own agendas, stop the flow of information and let their actions shape the story. React to what they do, consider the antagonists’ agendas, and start instigating.
[1:12 PM]
Henrik Hagen, [12/11/21, 8:12 am]
#tn After a scene, think of what the antagonists are doing in the meantime. You’re never going to set a scene that doesn’t have a protagonist in it, but you do want to consider what the antagonists do when they’re alone. Do they notice that the protagonists are snooping around in their schemes? Do they have the next stage of their plan to organize or enact? Then think about how the protagonists will see some evidence of these behind-the-scenes actions. Instead of proceeding to the scene the player had planned on next, a protagonist might get ambushed by a threat or unexpectedly walk into an event. Start a new scene with this encounter.

#tn Connections, factions, and maybe even threats may hire protagonists to further their agendas

Henrik Hagen, [12/11/21, 8:44 am]
Each protagonist has one or more close relationships with connections or other protagonists. Pay attention to these and write them down in your notes. You might even want to start a relationship map—similar to your plot map, but only involving characters and their personal relationships with each other—in order to get a good visual of what possibilities you have.
   When two protagonists have relationships with the same connection, make sure the connection is not okay with the status quo. Make it so that, if one relationship is going to persist, it means another has to change.
   Give missions. When relationship-heavy connections are attached to the plot map somehow, they’ll have an agenda. Have them play on their relationships to get the protagonists to act as agents for them
[1:13 PM]
#tn If a protagonist is surveying a crime scene, let her find the clues. If a
protagonist leans on her connection for info, you might have him act for a moment or two like he’s resistant to give it up, but don’t make it a matter of rolling dice.
Just spill it. A protagonist’s connections will always give her
something. Likewise, when she uses a connection for a favor, try to hint at how the situation changes based on how you’ve adjusted the plot map.   Now, if a protagonist is trying to get the truth out of a connection—an admission of guilt perhaps—or if she’s interrogating a connection that she doesn’t have, then we’re in contention territory and it’s time to roll dice.

#tn When the protagonists hit up a connection to gain a lead, Technoir assumes that the GM—taking into account the subject indicated, that subject’s position on the plot map, the connection’s relationship to the plot map, and the specific question that was asked of the connection—will provide an act of creative closure and figure out what the contact says.
But this doesn’t have to be as simple as, “I know that X is involved with Y.”
And, in fact, repeatedly relying on that simple construction can lead to a very predictable (and boring) pace for your game. Plus, it’s a staple of the noir genre that information—while it may point you in a direction that can be roughly described as
“forward”—will also mislead, misdirect, or otherwise baffle the protagonist.
So rather than simply knowing the answer to their question and pointing them
in the right direction, here are a few ways to complicate the leads your connections give out:
)) They give them inaccurate information about the target. )) They point them at a target connected to the conspiracy, but for reasons that have nothing to do with the conspiracy.
)) They don’t know anything, but they can introduce the protagonists to someone who might.
)) They claim they don’t know anything, but they seem afraid. )) They don’t know anything, but there was somebody else who was just asking them about the same thing.
)) They want money for the information. )) They don’t know anything, but they want to know, too. And they’ll pay if the protagonists can tell them anything.
[1:14 PM]
)) They don’t know anything right now, but if the protagonists come back tomorrow they’ll see what they can dig up. (That doesn’t actually mean that they’ll have anything—or even that they’ll be alive—when the protagonists come around.)
)) They warn the protagonists that they don’t want to mess around with the people involved (whether that’s a faction, a connection, or a threat).
)) They heard a rumor at a bar. There was a guy who mentioned A and B in the same sentence.
)) They set the protagonists up with a fake job while secretly calling a threat to ambush them.)) They’re holding an object for the subject of the protagonists’ interest.
If you’re still looking for inspiration, look at the connection’s favors. Think about how the favors they do (for both the protagonists and other people) can translate into information or opportunities: If they’ve got the chop favor, maybe they sold a car to the guy the protagonists are asking about (and secretly low-jacked it so that they can trace it). If it’s a date, maybe they took somebody to where the object is (or they can take the protagonists there themselves).
(If the lead actually involves the connection doing a favor  for the protagonist, don’t forget to activate the plot map accordingly.)

#tn The usual structure of a Technoir scenario is fairly straightforward: You’ll generate a mission seed. You’ll figure out what’s going on. You’ll hook the protagonists using one of the outlying nodes on the plot map. And then the protagonists will drill their way down to the core of the plot map, eventually revealing the mission seed and discovering the truth of what’s happening.But that’s not necessarily the way it needs to happen. It’s possible for the protagonists to never get anywhere near the core of the plot map (the heart of the conspiracy defined by the original mission seed). Instead, they can become completely wrapped up in a complex periphery of events that are being influenced or instigated by the conspiracy without being a direct part of it.

#tn link move can be used to restock if connections killed

Henrik Hagen, [12/11/21, 10:02 pm]
#tn As a connection to one of the protagonists, he’s obliged to give information when called on. But he can misdirect as long as some nugget of truth is revealed that moves the plot forward.

Henrik Hagen, [12/11/21, 10:14 pm]
#tn Instead, draw a line from that node to the connection being leaned on. Now, the protagonist has hit upon a part of the plot that the connection has a direct involvement with. When you take on the persona of the connection, you may be much less willing to divulge the truth. Connections can lie and mislead. Just make sure you give the player some new information, even if it’s just having the connection act suspicious.
