Favours

Cred: 40% of TN, rounded up

Chop: as written but 4 Cred

Date: as written

Deal: no mechanical effect, narrative only. First one free only of you personally and immediately consume it in front of the seller. Chemical or digital drug. Actually probably remove first one free.

Fence: as written but 2 Cred

Ride: as written

Shark: as written but 4 Cred

Splice: as written, but review the clause about the implant tag



Side notes: 
You have 3 giri questions that will be split between PC and NPCs.

You must end up with 3 NPC connections.

Npcs not connected to you by existing giri questions still need to be connected by giri.

Npcs need TN adjectives as well as veil giri.

Approximately half of all questions should be PCs, and half NPCs.

Cyber wear must cost to install (2 Cred in veil, 5 in TN). Give PC 1 extra credit and make them pay 2 (or favour) per cyberwar installed.

Probably need to make gear cost also -- *** no, don't worry about it. Let veil PCs starts with gear as per veil, they can use fix to get extra by spending their Cred (update TN favour prices to veil)

Ignore the veil. Rule that says link must be used at least once by everyone in the first session. Probably should actually remove it from play entirely.

What if PCs go to NPCs on game? TN p68 76 78. Check giri owed. Use link move? Check veil rules related to this stuff.




1. Char Gen not including giri questions or cyberwar, or beliefs. Give extra creds because PCs will have to pay for cyberwear and gear.

2 select transmission

3 veil rules for beliefs: invite other players to nominate their PCs for your questions.
Fill 1 or 2 of your 3 like this.

4. For the remaining 1 or 2 of your 3 questions choose NPCs from the transmission, and also choose the most appropriate adjective from p22 as per TN rules.

5. To get num of NPC connections up to 3, create giri with them: you have 1 on them, they have 1 on you. Also pick adjective as per TN p22.

6. Spend Cred. Here call in favours from connections. Max 2 times an NPC can be hit up in this phase.





#veil_technoir

PCs get 3 NPC connections. Connections will do favours, therefore PCs need to have giri on them.

Min 1 max 2 of giri questions should be for NPCs. But, for each NPC cnx created like this also have player choose best fitting adjective from TN p22. Allow the remaining NPC connections to be created with a giri in both directions, and an adjective (p22) from TN (players can extrapolate into a story)

Contact favours are defined by the transmission.
If PCs want Cyber wear they need to use favours during generation, else they start with none? They need to cash in their giri to do this of course.
(Each connection does Max 2 favours total during generation)

TN generation has PCs start with cash and spend some to buy and install cyber wear. P24. They'll only be able to afford to install 1 unless they call on favours.
I'll make them pay one Cred per Cyber wear? (Note that installing cost according to veil is 2 Cred). Connection favours give them a free one.

Veil: each PC is meant to use the link move (circles) at least once in first session. Should I ignore those? TN has other means of giving NPC cnx. Or, instead of allowing 1-1 giri with any extra NPCs need to get to 3 for a PC, should I make them roll link instead? I think ignore this veil requirement, TN needs PCs to have 3 favours to call on, don't leave it to a roll.
