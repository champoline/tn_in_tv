Using Technoir Transmissions with The Veil

1 select playbooks, do char gen up to but:
    dont do giri/obligation questions
    dont add cyberwear
    dont do beliefs

2. GM selects transmission, presents NPC contacts and their favours, and adjective list from TN p22, t oplayers

3. Players choose 3 cnx each from the transmission as per TN rules p20

4. Players ask (as per Veil 2e rules) for volunteer pcs to fill in their giri questions

5. Each player keeps 1-2 giri questions t obe filled by npc contacts (te player chooses)
        Each question fiulled by npc should *also* have the most fitting available adjective (how pc feels about npc - doesn't describe npc feeling) from TN p22 picked and applied as per TN rules
    
6. After giri questions all done, each pc will have 1-2 npc relationships. They need 3, so remaining npc relationships have 1 giri in each direction, and an adjective from p22.

because:

1. giri questions are applied to npcs as well as pcs, cyberwear costs cred and can also come from favours, beliefs are best done last anyway

2. 

4. want inter pc relationships
    want 3 npc relationships per pc, incluing adjectives

Goal is that approx half of all group's giri questions are filled with pcs, other half with npcs
