Using TechNoir Transmissions to play The Veil

This document outlines a method to use a Transmission from TechNoir when playing The Veil.

1. Create characters according The Veil, with the following exceptions:
    - Don't give PCs any cyberwear
    - Each PC receives 1 extra Cred on top of what's specified in The Veil rules
    - Don't complete PC Beliefs/Questions

2. Players select 3 Connections from the Transmission as per TN rules (p20)

3. Assign relationship adjectives as per TN rules (p22), and give each PC and their Connections get 1 Giri/Obligation on each other.
    
4. Players spend PC cred on gear or installing cyberwear, if they wish. 
    - Unlike in The Veil rules, during character generation each piece of cyberwear costs 2 cred to be installed.

5. Favours from Connections are called in, as per TN rules (p39,58).
    - See the modified Favours (based on TN p39) below.

6. Take turns creating Beliefs/Questions as per The Veil rules.
    


FAVORS
Protagonists can go to a connection for certain favors. Every time a con-
nection does a favor, they get more involved with the plot. See page 58
for more information on this process. Each connection can provide one or
more of the following (as listed with their stats in the Transmission):
  Chop: Sell you a stolen vehicle at an 8 Kred discount (add the stolen tag
for free) or buy a stolen vehicle from you at an 8 Kred discount.
  Date: Attend a function with you, getting you access somewhere you
wouldn’t be welcome otherwise.
  Deal: Provide a dose of drugs. First time is free, 1 Kred thereafter.
Taking them gives you the sticky negative adjective of high. Once
during the adjective’s duration, you can treat all the Hurt dice of a roll
as Action dice results. You can declare this after you roll.
  Fence: Buy a bulk load of stolen merchandise from you for 5 Kreds.
  Fix: Sell you up to three objects in specified categories, each discounted
by 2 Kreds. The discount may make them free. Add the stolen tag to
each.
  Ride: Transport you, a friend, or illicit goods to a destination inside or
just out of the city.
  Shark: Lend you 10 Kreds, expecting repayment. Mark this in the
“debt” column next to the connection.
  Splice: Install a cybernetic object (or an object with the implant tag)
for free.





Note.

Ignore the rule from The Veil that says the Link move must be used by each player in the first session. If your group allows the use of the Link move (awsome as it is) don't forget that even on a 10+ the NPC that results isn't a Connection, and can't provide the same benefits that a Connection can.
Link move can be used to restock connections list if some klled
